In recent years, the growth of electronic banking has boosted financial fraud, which results in billions of dollars of loss worldwide each year. Several machine learning techniques for detecting fraud are evolved and applied to detect credit card fraud. This paper aims to provide a comparative analysis and comprehensive review of different approaches to detecting fraud. This paper investigates the performance of logistic regression, decision trees, XGBoost, k-nearest neighbour (k-NN), random forest and LightGBM on highly unbalanced credit card fraud data. The dataset contains 284,807 credit card transactions made in September 2013 by European cardholders. The performance of each model is evaluated based on classification reports and a confusion matrix.
