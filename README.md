# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning
This repository contains the Major Research Project (MRP). The project focuses on detecting credit card fraud using various machine learning techniques, providing a comprehensive comparative analysis of different models' performance on a highly imbalanced dataset.

## Overview
The project aims to explore and evaluate multiple machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, XGBoost, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), random forest, and LightGBM, for their effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions within credit card data. The dataset analyzed comprises 284,807 credit card transactions from European cardholders in September 2013, with a focus on addressing the challenges posed by highly imbalanced data.

## Key Objectives
To conduct a comparative analysis of various machine learning models on their ability to detect credit card fraud.
To evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1-score, precision, confusion matrix, and ROC.
To address the challenges of working with highly imbalanced datasets and improve model sensitivity towards fraud detection.
### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle, provided by the Machine Learning Group of Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles (ULB). It contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders, with a very small proportion of fraudulent transactions.

## Methods and Results
The project explores different data preprocessing techniques, including PCA for dimensionality reduction and SMOTE for handling imbalanced data. The analysis and experiments conducted provide insights into the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms in identifying fraudulent transactions, highlighting the significance of model selection and hyperparameter tuning.

## Conclusion
This research project contributes to the field of fraud detection by evaluating the performance of multiple machine learning models on a real-world, highly imbalanced dataset. The findings underscore the importance of choosing appropriate data preprocessing and model evaluation strategies to enhance fraud detection accuracy.
